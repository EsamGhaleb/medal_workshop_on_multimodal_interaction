00:00:00.151 --> 00:00:02.092
It's a beautiful wedding, people.

2
00:00:02.112 --> 00:00:03.753
I'm sure everybody flew.

3
00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:07.656
And what do I see behind a palm tree where I'm hiding?

4
00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:14.740
I see the beautiful wedding cake in a little table with two chairs for the bride and the groom.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.842
Instead of the bride and the groom, there is lupÃ© and Angie.

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:37.019
