1
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.224
One of my earliest memories is trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to.

2
00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:20.426
And I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why.

3
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:25.250
But as I got older, I realized we had drug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction.

4
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:34.957
I've been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly a hundred years since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain, and we then imposed that on the rest of the world.

5
00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:39.040
It's a century since we made this really fateful decision.

6
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:47.746
to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer because we believe that would deter them, it would give them an incentive to stop.

7
00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:56.171
And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them.

8
00:00:57.243 --> 00:01:01.324
And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to.

9
00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:03.765
Like, what really causes addiction?

10
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:07.086
Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working?

11
00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:09.827
And is there a better way out there that we could try instead?

12
00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:13.568
So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for.

13
00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:21.510
So I thought, OK, I'll go and sit with different people around the world who've lived this and studied this and taught to them and see if I can learn from them.

14
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:35.498
And I ended up, I didn't realise I would end up going over thirty thousand miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to Mongooses to see if they like them.

15
00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:38.820
It turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances.

16
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.303
To the only country that's ever decriminalised all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal.

17
00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:50.607
And the thing I realised that really blew my mind is, almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong.

18
00:01:51.685 --> 00:01:57.507
And if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction, I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies.

19
00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:00.989
But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I know, right?

20
00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:02.990
Let's think about this middle row here, right?

21
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.272
Imagine all of you for twenty days now went off and used heroin three times a day.

22
00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:11.063
Some of you look a little bit more enthusiastic than others at this prospect.

23
00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:13.774
Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment.

24
00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:15.035
Imagine you did that, right?

25
00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:16.755
What would happen?

26
00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.977
Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.

27
00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:32.642
We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those twenty days, you'd all be heroin addicts, right?

28
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:33.862
That's what I thought.

29
00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:35.843
The first thing that alerted me to the fact

30
00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.084
something not right with this story.

31
00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:46.587
So when it's explained to me, if I step out of this TED talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of dire morphine.

32
00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:48.808
Dire morphine is heroin.

33
00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:58.212
It's actually much better heroin than you're ever going to buy on the streets because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated actually very little of it is heroin whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure.

34
00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:00.513
And you'll be giving it for quite a long period of time.

35
00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:01.634
There are loads of people in this room.

36
00:03:01.654 --> 00:03:04.215
I mean, I realize that you've taken quite a lot of heroin, right?

37
00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:07.817
And anyone watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening.

38
00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:13.061
And if what we believe about addiction is right, those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks.

39
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.421
What should happen?

40
00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:16.423
They should become addicts.

41
00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:18.484
This has been studied really carefully.

42
00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:19.685
It doesn't happen.

43
00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:23.607
You will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie.

44
00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:27.715
And when I learned this, it just seemed so weird to me.

45
00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:30.075
So contrary to everything I'd been told of it, I thought I knew.

46
00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:31.716
I just thought it couldn't be right.

47
00:03:32.156 --> 00:03:40.118
Until I went in that man called Bruce Alexander, who's a professor of psychology in Vancouver, who carried out an incredible experiment that I think really helps us to understand this issue.

48
00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:49.561
Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we've all got on our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the twentieth century.

49
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:51.121
They're really simple experiments.

50
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:53.842
You can do them tonight when you go home if you feel a little bit sadistic.

51
00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:58.064
You get a rat and you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles.

52
00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:01.726
One is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.

53
00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:08.089
If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly.

54
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.350
So there you go, right?

55
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.011
That's how we think it works.

56
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.773
In the seventies, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something.

57
00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:18.815
He said, ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage.

58
00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.036
It's got nothing to do except use these drugs.

59
00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.237
Let's try something a bit different.

60
00:04:22.737 --> 00:04:28.281
So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called Rat Park, which is basically heaven for rats, right?

61
00:04:28.862 --> 00:04:32.685
They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of coloured balls, they've got loads of tunnels.

62
00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:36.288
Crucially, they've got loads of friends, they can have loads of sex.

63
00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:41.152
And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drug water.

64
00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:43.327
But here's the fascinating thing.

65
00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:46.929
In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.

66
00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:48.869
They almost never use it.

67
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.270
None of them ever use it compulsively.

68
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.071
None of them ever overdose.

69
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:59.913
You go from almost a hundred percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives.

70
00:05:00.273 --> 00:05:04.575
Now, when I first saw this professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just the thing about rats.

71
00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:05.695
They're quite different to us.

72
00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:07.356
Maybe not as different as we'd like.

73
00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:13.687
But fortunately there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time.

74
00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.471
It was called the Vietnam War.

75
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.521
In Vietnam, twenty percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin.

76
00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:30.185
And if you look at the news reports from the time, they were really worried because they thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends.

77
00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:31.485
It made total sense.

78
00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:34.826
Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home.

79
00:05:35.146 --> 00:05:38.487
The archives of general psychiatry did a really detailed study and what happened to them?

80
00:05:39.268 --> 00:05:39.888
It turns out

81
00:05:40.668 --> 00:05:41.768
They didn't go to rehab.

82
00:05:42.428 --> 00:05:43.769
They didn't go into withdrawal.

83
00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.230
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.

84
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.010
Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense.

85
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:54.711
But Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction.

86
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.812
He said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks?

87
00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:00.773
What if addiction is about your cage?

88
00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:04.254
What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment?

89
00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:10.115
Looking at this, there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction.

90
00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:12.338
Maybe we should call it bonding.

91
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.085
Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond.

92
00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:19.190
And when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other.

93
00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:21.034
But if you can't do that,

94
00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:28.719
because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief.

95
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:39.930
Now that might be gambling, that might be pornography, that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature, that's what we want as human beings.

96
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.650
And I think

97
00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:49.860
You know, at first I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head round, but one way to help me to think about it is, and I can see, yeah, I've got over by my seat there, a bottle of water, right?

98
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.542
I'm looking at lots of you and lots of you have bottles of water with you, right?

99
00:06:53.443 --> 00:06:54.965
Forget drugs, forget the drug war.

100
00:06:55.405 --> 00:06:59.569
Totally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right?

101
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.912
We could all be getting drunk, I might after this.

102
00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:04.834
But we're not, right?

103
00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:13.439
Now because you've been able to afford the approximately a gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months.

104
00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:14.940
You wouldn't end up homeless.

105
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.761
You're not going to do that.

106
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.562
And the reason you're not going to do that.

107
00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:21.190
is not because anyone's stopping you.

108
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.911
It's because you've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for.

109
00:07:25.172 --> 00:07:26.232
You've got work you love.

110
00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:27.413
You've got people you love.

111
00:07:27.693 --> 00:07:29.674
You've got healthy relationships.

112
00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:38.398
And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests, is about not being able to bear to be present in your life.

113
00:07:38.818 --> 00:07:41.459
Now, this has really significant implications.

114
00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:44.081
The most obvious implications are for the war on drugs, right?

115
00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:56.831
In Arizona, I went out with a group of women who were made to wear t-shirts saying I was a drug addict and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public could cheer at them.

116
00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:02.244
And when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again.

117
00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:05.688
Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang.

118
00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:09.813
But actually, almost everywhere in the world, we treat addicts to some degree like that.

119
00:08:09.873 --> 00:08:11.035
We punish them, we shame them.

120
00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:12.457
We give them criminal records.

121
00:08:12.717 --> 00:08:14.719
We put barriers between them reconnecting.

122
00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:17.580
There was a doctor in Canada, Dr.

123
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.343
Gabor Marté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system.

124
00:08:24.023 --> 00:08:28.706
Now, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite, and I went there to see how it worked.

125
00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:32.768
In the year two thousand, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe.

126
00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:36.310
One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing.

127
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.051
And every year, they tried the American way more and more.

128
00:08:39.312 --> 00:08:41.533
They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more.

129
00:08:42.113 --> 00:08:43.734
and every year the problem got worse.

130
00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:50.836
And one day the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together and basically said, look, we can't go on with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts.

131
00:08:51.236 --> 00:08:56.618
Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem.

132
00:08:56.878 --> 00:08:58.699
And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr.

133
00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:01.200
Hwagulow to look at all this new evidence.

134
00:09:02.062 --> 00:09:08.664
And they came back and they said, decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack.

135
00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:19.508
But, and this is the crucial next step, take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it instead on reconnecting them with the society.

136
00:09:20.577 --> 00:09:26.722
And that's not really what we think of, what they did wasn't really what we think of as drug treatment in the United States and Britain.

137
00:09:26.882 --> 00:09:30.765
So they do do residential rehab, they do do psychological therapy that does have some value.

138
00:09:31.005 --> 00:09:33.327
But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do.

139
00:09:33.787 --> 00:09:39.372
A massive program of job creation for addicts and micro loans for addicts to set up small businesses.

140
00:09:39.672 --> 00:09:40.893
So say you used to be a mechanic.

141
00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:46.036
When you're ready, they go to a garage and they'll say, if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages.

142
00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:50.559
The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning.

143
00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:55.182
And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal, it's fascinating what they said is, as they rediscovered purpose.

144
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.312
They rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society.

145
00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:04.516
It'll be fifteen years this year since that experiment began, and the results sit in.

146
00:10:05.297 --> 00:10:18.926
Injecting drug use is down in Portugal, according to the British Journal of Criminology, by fifty percent, five zero percent, overdoses massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts, addiction in every study is significantly down.

147
00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:23.590
One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system.

148
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.131
Now, that's the kind of political implications.

149
00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:29.111
Actually, there's a layer of implications to all this research below that.

150
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:37.554
You know, we live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating.

151
00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:42.895
You know, before these talks began, you guys know this, that we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on.

152
00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:49.217
And I have to say, a lot of you looked at awful lot like addicts who were being told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours.

153
00:10:50.237 --> 00:10:51.438
Yeah, a lot of us feel like that.

154
00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:56.560
And it might sound weird to say, oh, you know, I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction.

155
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.821
But weird to say it's growing because you think, well, we're the most connected society there's ever been, surely.

156
00:11:01.302 --> 00:11:08.024
But I increasingly began to think that the connection we have, the connections we have, we think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection.

157
00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:10.966
If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something.

158
00:11:11.726 --> 00:11:13.907
It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you.

159
00:11:14.647 --> 00:11:17.068
It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round.

160
00:11:17.568 --> 00:11:22.530
It'll be your flesh and blood friends so you have deep and nuanced and textured face-to-face relationships with.

161
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:28.912
And I think there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibbin, the environmental writer, I think tells us a lot about this.

162
00:11:29.592 --> 00:11:34.334
It looked at the number of close friends, the average American believes they can call on in a crisis.

163
00:11:34.754 --> 00:11:37.355
That number has been declining steadily since the nineteen fifties.

164
00:11:37.915 --> 00:11:42.477
The amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing.

165
00:11:42.897 --> 00:11:46.580
And I think that's like a metaphor for the choice we've made as a culture, right?

166
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:55.086
We've traded floor space for friends, we've traded stuff for connections, and the result is that we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been.

167
00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:59.470
And Bruce Alexander, the guide of the Ratt Park experiment, says, we talk all the time in addiction.

168
00:12:00.403 --> 00:12:01.664
about individual recovery.

169
00:12:02.064 --> 00:12:03.344
And it's right to talk about that.

170
00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.086
But we need to talk much more about social recovery.

171
00:12:06.506 --> 00:12:09.587
Something's gone wrong with us, not just as individuals, but as a group.

172
00:12:09.847 --> 00:12:16.310
And we created a society where for a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like rap park.

173
00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:20.272
But if I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it, right?

174
00:12:20.652 --> 00:12:23.253
I didn't go into discover the political stuff, the social stuff.

175
00:12:23.774 --> 00:12:25.675
I wanted to know how to help the people I love.

176
00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:28.576
And when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this,

177
00:12:30.468 --> 00:12:40.482
I look to the addicts of my life and if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room, you're angry a lot of the time.

178
00:12:41.514 --> 00:12:47.798
And I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us, right?

179
00:12:48.318 --> 00:12:52.300
Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you.

180
00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:58.564
And the kind of script we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by, I think, by the reality show intervention.

181
00:12:58.604 --> 00:13:02.286
If you guys haven't seen it, I think everything in our lives is typified by reality TV, but that's another TED talk.

182
00:13:04.307 --> 00:13:06.708
If you're noticing the show intervention, it's pretty simple premise.

183
00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:15.231
You get an addict, all the people in their life gather them together, and say, if you don't shape up, they confront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up, we're going to cut you off, right?

184
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:18.673
So what they do is they take the connection to the addict, and they threaten it.

185
00:13:18.993 --> 00:13:22.074
They make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want.

186
00:13:23.494 --> 00:13:27.496
And I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work.

187
00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:30.217
And I began to think that almost that's like the importing

188
00:13:31.157 --> 00:13:33.658
of the logic of the drug war into our private lives.

189
00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:37.660
So I was thinking, well, how can I be Portuguese, right?

190
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:54.186
And what I try to do now, and I can't tell you, I do it consistently, and I can't tell you it's easy, is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen the connection with them, to say to them, I love you, whether you're using or you're not, I love you, whatever state you're in,

191
00:13:55.022 --> 00:14:00.726
And if you need me, I'll come and sit with you because I love you and I don't want you to be alone or to feel alone.

192
00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:11.894
And I think the core of that message, you're not alone, we love you, has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts socially, politically and individually.

193
00:14:12.474 --> 00:14:16.437
For a hundred years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts.

194
00:14:17.479 --> 00:14:24.304
I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety.

195
00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:28.127
The opposite of addiction is connection.

196
00:14:29.108 --> 00:14:29.468
Thank you.
