" It's a beautiful wedding, people."
I'm sure everybody flew.
And what do I see behind a palm tree where I'm hiding?
I see the beautiful wedding cake in a little table with two chairs for the bride and the groom.
"Instead of the bride and the groom, there is lup√© and Angie."
" Seating perfectly and Everybody's trying to get the dogs and they really are not mean dogs, but they were faking it really well This what they would do they'd like It has fast as they can't and then they would go ah Full of men"
