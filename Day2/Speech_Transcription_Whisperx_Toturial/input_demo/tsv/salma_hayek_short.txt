00:00:01.312	00:00:07.656	What do I see behind a palm tree where I'm hiding?
00:00:08.876	00:00:14.740	I see the beautiful wedding cake in a little table with two chairs for the bride and the groom.
00:00:14.940	00:00:17.842	Instead of the bride and the groom, there is Lupe and Angie.
00:00:19.669	00:00:28.865	Seating perfectly, and everybody's trying to get the dogs, and they really are not mean dogs, but they were faking it really well.
00:00:29.225	00:00:30.067	This is what they would do.
00:00:30.748	00:00:35.877	They'd like it as fast as they could, and then they would go, whaa!
00:00:36.318	00:00:37.019	Full of men!
