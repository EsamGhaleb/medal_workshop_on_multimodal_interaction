# Methods for the automatic processing of multimodal interaction - Raquel Fernandez & Esam Ghaleb
This workshop will introduce fundamental methods for analysing multimodal signals in conversation. On the first day, we will discuss how to process kinematic information (i.e., how to extract key body points) and automatically transcribe and align speech from dialogue video recordings. On the second day, we will build on this knowledge to develop methods that allow us to automatically detect gestures using speech and kinematic features. Each workshop day will consist of a short presentation of at most 45 minutes, followed by hands-on practical exercises and discussion.

## Prerequisites
- **Level**: Suitable for anyone interested in multimodal interaction.  
- **Skills**: Basic programming ability, preferably in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Software
We will use the following tools; no installation required beforehand—we’ll set them up during the workshop:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Python environment manager)
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) (kinematic feature extraction)
- [whisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) (automated speech transcription & alignment)
- [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) (annotation tool for multimodal data)
